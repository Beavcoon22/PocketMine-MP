#Pocketmine Plugin Tutorial
#Basic Structure of Plugins
#
#Version Alpha
#Revision 1.0.0

Hello,
In this tutorial, we will be looking at the basic structure of a plugin.

Basically, this is the structure of a plugin in PocketMine-MP
--------------------
<?php

/*
__PocketMine Plugin__
name=HelloWorld
version=1.0.0
author=sekjun9878
class=HelloWorld
*/

class HelloWorld implements Plugin{
	private $api;
	public function __construct(ServerAPI $api, $server = false){
		$this->api = $api;
	}
	
	public function init(){
		$this->api->console->register("example", "Example command", array($this, "handleCommand"));
	}
	
	public function __destruct(){
	
	}
	
	public function handleCommand($cmd, $arg){
		switch($cmd){
			case "example":
				console("Hello World!");
				break;
		}
	}

}
--------------------
Code 1.0. Structure of a basic plugin.

As you can see, there are 4 parts to this very basic plugin.
Let's go through a few of them
	init()
		init is a function that is called at when the plugin is loaded by PocketMine.
		Usually you would register all the commands and events your plugin needs to be notified of.
	handleCommand
		handleCommand is not a compulsory function. Meaning it does not have to exist.
		The name of this function can be changed to anything you want.
		But you have to use the same name when registering command and events on line
		"$this->api->console->register("example", "Example command", array($this, "handleCommand"));"
